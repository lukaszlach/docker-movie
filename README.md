## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaszlach/docker-movie.git
cd docker-movie/
```

```bash
# Render text frames
make frames MOVIE=movie.avi
make frames MOVIE=movie.mp4

# Render 1/10 frames-per-second (fps)
make frames MOVIE=movie.mpg FPS=1/10
# Render 2fps, that would result in quite big image size
make frames MOVIE=movie.mpg FPS=2

# Build Docker image
make build

# Play the movie
make run

# Fast-forward
make run SEEK=500
# Control the playback speed
make run SLEEP=0.4
# Drop a single frame from the movie
make run SEEK=100 ONCE=1

# Play
make run
^C
